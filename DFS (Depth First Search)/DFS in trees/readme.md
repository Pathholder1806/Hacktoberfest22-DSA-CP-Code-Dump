# Depth First Search using Tree Data Strucutres


### Depth-first search

DFS (Depth-first search) is technique used for traversing tree or graph. Here backtracking is used for traversal. In this traversal first the deepest node is visited and then backtracks to itâ€™s parent node if no sibling of that node exist. 

### DFS Traversal of a Graph vs Tree

In graph, there might be cycles and dis-connectivity. Unlike graph, tree does not contain cycle and always connected. So DFS of a tree is relatively easier. We can simply begin from a node, then traverse its adjacent (or children) without caring about cycles. And if we begin from a single node (root), and traverse this way, it is guaranteed that we traverse the whole tree as there is no dis-connectivity,
