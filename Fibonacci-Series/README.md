### Fibonacci Sequence
#### A Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence starting from "0 , 1" and in which the succeeding term is the sum of preceding two terms.
#### 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13..... and so on.

### Steps to Print Fibonacci Sequence:
* Take Input from the User about number of elements and store in variable "number".
* Declare variables "num1=0" and "num2=1" , the first two elemnts of the sequence.
* Declare a temporary variable "temp=0".
* Print 0 and 1 which are starting two elements  of sequence.
* Using a for loop starting from 2 , because we already printed first two elements.
* Inside loop , assign temp=num1+num2 and Print out temp with a space using " ".
* Assign Num1=Num2 and Num2=temp.
* Loop will print out the remaining elements of the sequence.
