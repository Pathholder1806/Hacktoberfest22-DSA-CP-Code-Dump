The __selection sort__ algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. <br>
The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array. <br>
- The subarray which already sorted. 
- The remaining subarray was unsorted.

In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
